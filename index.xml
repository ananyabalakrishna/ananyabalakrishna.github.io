      <description>Functional materials  We engineer microstructures in ferroelectric materials to develop novel nanoscale device concepts, such as actuators and energy harvesters.
Functional materials are characterized by their native properties and functions of their own, such as ferroelectricity, magnetism and light-interactive properties. These materials show a large response to small stimuli and are used in sensors, actuators, memory devices and energy harvesters. We develop multi-physics models to computationally engineer material microstructures that can drastically enhance material performance.</description>

      <description>Ananya Renuka Balakrishna Provost&amp;rsquo;s Assistant Professor Fellow
Starting Fall 2020 CV
I will be recruiting two PhD students starting August 2020. You neither need to be a coding expert nor have had multiple publications. You simply need to be interested to pursue research at the intersection of solid mechanics, materials and mathematics. Please feel free to email me with questions at arenukab@umn.edu.</description>

      <description> We draw inspiration from geometric patterns to understand the fundamental principles of symmetry. We apply these mathematical rules in the form of computer codes to generate art. For example, the following Islamic tesssellation is generated by regularly repeating a motif with star polygons (8 nodes, 22 nodes) on a hexagonal lattice.

      <title>Does electrode crystallography affect a battery&#39;s lifespan?</title>

      <description>Every few years, we notice a drop in our phone&amp;rsquo;s battery capacity. Eventually, we need to replace these batteries, which is not only expensive but also depletes earth&amp;rsquo;s reserves of rare elements. There are several causes for battery fade, such as depletion of active ions, discharge rate and mechanical degration of battery materials. In our recent paper, we demonstrate that repeatedly charging/discharging a battery is another reason, which makes electrodes brittle and prone to failure.</description>

      <title>What happens inside a rutile electrode during battery operation?</title>

      <description>Rutile nano-electrodes undergo structural changes during repeated battery operation  
Using a combination of total scattering analysis and transmission electron microscopy, Christensen et al. investigate the atomic-scale structure of the rutile (TiO2) electrode during charge-discharge process. They demonstrated the phase-change behavior of rutile as it transformed from an ordered to a disordered state with repeated cycling.
Why do these nano-electrodes amorphize and not fracture?  
On the theory front, we reasoned as to why the rutile nano-particles amorphized (phase-change behavior) instead of dissipating their stored elastic energy by electrode fracture.</description>
