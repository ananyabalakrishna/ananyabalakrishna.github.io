      <description>Mathematical Design of Energy-related Materials Today, we have a need to not only discover materials with enhanced properties but to do them urgently &amp;ndash; there is a need to establish a quantitative design framework to accelerate materials development. Finding these design principles is the focus of our research group. In this talk, we share our recent findings on magnetic materials and battery materials, and propose design conditions to enhance their performance and lifespans.</description>

      <description>A search for magnetic alloys with low hysteresis In this talk, we explain how a delicate balance between material instability and magnetic constants can dramatically reduce hysteresis in magnetic alloys. These alloys find important applications in wind turbines and induction motors of electric vehicles, and our research could potentially guide in the discovery of novel soft magnets.

      <description>We draw inspiration from geometric patterns to understand the fundamental principles of symmetry. We apply these mathematical rules in the form of computer codes to generate art. For example, the following Islamic tesssellation is generated by regularly repeating a motif with star polygons (8 nodes, 22 nodes) on a hexagonal lattice.

      <description>Every few years, we notice a drop in our phone&amp;rsquo;s battery capacity. Eventually, we need to replace these batteries, which is not only expensive but also depletes earth&amp;rsquo;s reserves of rare elements. There are several causes for battery fade, such as depletion of active ions, discharge rate and mechanical degration of battery materials. In our recent paper, we demonstrate that repeatedly charging/discharging a battery is another reason, which makes electrodes brittle and prone to failure.</description>

      <title>What happens inside a rutile electrode during battery operation?</title>

      <description>Rutile nano-electrodes undergo structural changes during repeated battery operation  Using a combination of total scattering analysis and transmission electron microscopy, Christensen et al. investigate the atomic-scale structure of the rutile (TiO2) electrode during charge-discharge process. They demonstrated the phase-change behavior of rutile as it transformed from an ordered to a disordered state with repeated cycling.
Why do these nano-electrodes amorphize and not fracture?  On the theory front, we reasoned as to why the rutile nano-particles amorphized (phase-change behavior) instead of dissipating their stored elastic energy by electrode fracture.</description>
