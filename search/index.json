[{"content":"\n","href":"/","title":"Home"},{"content":" Functional materials  We engineer microstructures in ferroelectric materials to develop novel nanoscale device concepts, such as actuators and energy harvesters.\nFunctional materials are characterized by their native properties and functions of their own, such as ferroelectricity, magnetism and light-interactive properties. These materials show a large response to small stimuli and are used in sensors, actuators, memory devices and energy harvesters. We develop multi-physics models to computationally engineer material microstructures that can drastically enhance material performance. For example, in our past projects we uses phase-field methods to engineer ferroelectric actuators with enhanced displacements, energy harvesters with increased reversibility, and memory elements with superior storage density.\nEnergy storage materials  We engineer both material microstructure and material crystallography to enhance battery lifespans.\nBatteries are now used in very high volumes of everyday applications such as powering mobile phones, laptops and other portable electronic devices. These batteries are promising candidates for sustainable energy storage, although their use in high energy density applications, like powering electric vehicles, is still a challenge. A key limitation of the battery performance is the structural instability of battery materials with continuous usage and increased energy density requirements. Our central aim is to crystallographically and microstructurally engineer battery materials, such as electrodes, solid-electrolytes, in order to enhance energy storage capacity and lifespan. In our group, we use martensite crystallographic theory and phase-field methods, to design a new generation of battery electrodes—which offers minimum volume changes, enhanced conductivity and longer lifespans.\nMaterial modeling  We develop mathematical models, across multiple length scales, to understand fundamental material behavior.\nIn our group, we develop mathematical models, across multiple length scales, to understand fundamental material behaviour. Specifically, we are interested in developing theoretical and computational tools that predict material response to various loading conditions in phase transformation materials. These theoretical tools will guide in the discovery of materials with enhanced capabilities, and provide a systematic methodology to engineer materials from a bottom-up approach. Methods of interest to our group include, phase-field models, cohesive-zone models, molecular dynamics, and phase-field crystal models.\n","href":"/research/","title":"Research"},{"content":" Ananya Renuka Balakrishna Provost\u0026rsquo;s Assistant Professor Fellow\nStarting Fall 2020 CV\nI will be recruiting two PhD students starting August 2020.

Eventually, we need to replace these batteries, which is not only expensive but also depletes earth\u0026rsquo;s reserves of rare elements. There are several causes for battery fade, such as depletion of active ions, discharge rate and mechanical degration of battery materials. In our recent paper, we demonstrate that repeatedly charging/discharging a battery is another reason, which makes electrodes brittle and prone to failure.\nLi diffuses into interstitial lattice sites during battery operation  \nDuring a charge/discharge cycle, Li-diffuses through an electrode\u0026rsquo;s interstitial lattice sites and can induce substantial volume changes. This creates a gradient in lattice parameters as a function of Li-concentration, which produces stresses at the proximity of a grain boundary. We hypothesize that these stresses induce grain boundary movement that affect an electrode\u0026rsquo;s mechanical strength.\nMultiscale modeling of electrode microstructures  \nWe test our hypothesis by computing grain growth in sixty FePO4 electrodes in two parallel studies. In the first study, we electrochemically cycle the electrode and calculate Li-diffusion induced grain growth. In the second study, we do not cycle the electrode and calculate curvature-drive grain growth.\nLi diffusion induces grain growth in electrodes  \nWe find a statistically significant grain growth in the cycled electrodes, and negligible grain growth in the noncycled electrodes. These results suggest that Li-diffusion is an additional process that increases mean grain size in electrodes.\nOverall, we find that repeatedly charging/discharging a battery influences the crystallographic texture of its materials, which makes them brittle and prone to failure.\nReference  Balakrishna, A.

They demonstrated the phase-change behavior of rutile as it transformed from an ordered to a disordered state with repeated cycling.\nWhy do these nano-electrodes amorphize and not fracture?  \nOn the theory front, we reasoned as to why the rutile nano-particles amorphized (phase-change behavior) instead of dissipating their stored elastic energy by electrode fracture. Our fracture analysis calculations estimated the critical size of rutile nano-particles below which fracture is suppressed to be ∼20 nm. The nano-particle sizes used in this experiment were about ~11nm.\nReference  Christensen, C. K., Mamakhel, A., Balakrishna, A. R., Iversen, B. B., Chiang, Y. M., \u0026amp; Ravnsbæk, D.
