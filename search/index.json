Specifically, we are interested in developing theoretical and computational tools that predict material response to various loading conditions in phase transformation materials. These theoretical tools will guide in the discovery of materials with enhanced capabilities, and provide a systematic methodology to engineer materials from a bottom-up approach. Methods of interest to our group include, phase-field models, cohesive-zone models, molecular dynamics, and phase-field crystal models.\nIntercalation materials \rW3.CSS\r\r\u0026#10094;\r\u0026#10095;\r\r\rvar slideIndex = [1];\rvar slideId = [\"mySlides1\"]\rshowDivs(1, 0);\rfunction plusDivs(n, no) {\rshowDivs(slideIndex[no] += n, no);\r}\rfunction showDivs(n, no) {\rvar i;\rvar x = document.getElementsByClassName(slideId[no]);\rif (n  x.length) {slideIndex[no] = 1}\rif (n \r\rWe engineer both material microstructure and material crystallography to enhance battery lifespans.\nBatteries are now used in very high volumes of everyday applications such as powering mobile phones, laptops and other portable electronic devices. These batteries are promising candidates for sustainable energy storage, although their use in high energy density applications, like powering electric vehicles, is still a challenge. A key limitation of the battery performance is the structural instability of battery materials with continuous usage and increased energy density requirements. Our central aim is to crystallographically and microstructurally engineer battery materials, such as electrodes, solid-electrolytes, in order to enhance energy storage capacity and lifespan. In our group, we use martensite crystallographic theory and phase-field methods, to design a new generation of battery electrodes—which offers minimum volume changes, enhanced conductivity and longer lifespans.\nMagnetic materials \rW3.CSS\r\r\u0026#10094;\r\u0026#10095;\r\r\rvar slideIndex = [1,1];\rvar slideId = [\"mySlides1\",\"mySlides2\"]\rshowDivs(1, 0);\rshowDivs(1, 1);\rfunction plusDivs(n, no) {\rshowDivs(slideIndex[no] += n, no);\r}\rfunction showDivs(n, no) {\rvar i;\rvar x = document.getElementsByClassName(slideId[no]);\rif (n  x.length) {slideIndex[no] = 1}\rif (n \r We show that a delicate balance between local instabilities and magnetic material constants can dramatically reduce hysteresis in softmagnet alloys.\nIn 1914, a magnetic alloy with an unusually high magnetic permeability and low hysteresis was discovered at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. Under a very specific combination of the alloy composition (78.5% nickel content), the magnetic alloy (now known as the permalloy) demonstrates a drastic increase in the magnetic permeability and a decrease in the coercive force. In the past, this unusual behavior of the permalloy has been attributed to the anisotropy constant, however, there is still no theory that explains this drastic decrease in hysteresis in magnetic alloys. Our goal is to identify a mathematical relation between the magnetic material constants that is key in reducing hysteresis in magnetic materials. To this end, we have developed a novel coercivity tool that shows a combination of a large local disturbance (material microstructure) and magnetic constants contributes to the dramatic decrease in hysteresis in magnetic alloys.\nFerroelectric materials \rW3.CSS\r\r\r\r\r\r\u0026#10094;\r\u0026#10095;\r\r\rvar slideIndex = [1,1,1];\rvar slideId = [\"mySlides1\",\"mySlides2\",\"mySlides3\"]\rshowDivs(1, 0);\rshowDivs(1, 1);\rshowDivs(1, 2);\rfunction plusDivs(n, no) {\rshowDivs(slideIndex[no] += n, no);\r}\rfunction showDivs(n, no) {\rvar i;\rvar x = document.getElementsByClassName(slideId[no]);\rif (n  x.length) {slideIndex[no] = 1}\rif (n \r We engineer microstructures in ferroelectric materials to develop novel nanoscale device concepts, such as actuators and energy harvesters.\nFunctional materials are characterized by their native properties and functions of their own, such as ferroelectricity, magnetism and light-interactive properties.

We develop multi-physics models to computationally engineer material microstructures that can drastically enhance material performance. For example, in our past projects we use phase-field methods to engineer ferroelectric actuators with enhanced displacements, energy harvesters with increased reversibility, and memory elements with superior storage density.\n","href":"/research/","title":"Research"},{"content":"Ananya Renuka Balakrishna\nAssistant Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering (CV)\nEmail: renukaba@usc.edu\nDelin Zhang\nPh.D. Student\nEmail: delinzha@usc.edu\nAshwin Atul Daware\nMaster\u0026rsquo;s Student\nEmail: daware@usc.edu\nCarl Anthony Kohnke\nUndergraduate Student\nEmail: ckohnke@usc.edu\nBenjamin Bedregal Barboza\nUndergraduate Student\nEmail: bedregal@usc.edu\nOpenings We are always looking for motivated Ph.D. students to join our group.

Eventually, we need to replace these batteries, which is not only expensive but also depletes earth\u0026rsquo;s reserves of rare elements. There are several causes for battery fade, such as depletion of active ions, discharge rate and mechanical degration of battery materials. In our recent paper, we demonstrate that repeatedly charging/discharging a battery is another reason, which makes electrodes brittle and prone to failure.\nLi diffuses into interstitial lattice sites during battery operation \r During a charge/discharge cycle, Li-diffuses through an electrode\u0026rsquo;s interstitial lattice sites and can induce substantial volume changes. This creates a gradient in lattice parameters as a function of Li-concentration, which produces stresses at the proximity of a grain boundary. We hypothesize that these stresses induce grain boundary movement that affect an electrode\u0026rsquo;s mechanical strength.\nMultiscale modeling of electrode microstructures \r We test our hypothesis by computing grain growth in sixty FePO4 electrodes in two parallel studies. In the first study, we electrochemically cycle the electrode and calculate Li-diffusion induced grain growth. In the second study, we do not cycle the electrode and calculate curvature-drive grain growth.\nLi diffusion induces grain growth in electrodes \r We find a statistically significant grain growth in the cycled electrodes, and negligible grain growth in the noncycled electrodes. These results suggest that Li-diffusion is an additional process that increases mean grain size in electrodes.\nOverall, we find that repeatedly charging/discharging a battery influences the crystallographic texture of its materials, which makes them brittle and prone to failure.\nReference  Balakrishna, A.
