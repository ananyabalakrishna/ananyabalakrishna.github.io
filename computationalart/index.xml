      <description>Mathematical Design of Energy-related Materials Today, we have a need to not only discover materials with enhanced properties but to do them urgently &amp;ndash; there is a need to establish a quantitative design framework to accelerate materials development. Finding these design principles is the focus of our research group. In this talk, we share our recent findings on magnetic materials and battery materials, and propose design conditions to enhance their performance and lifespans.</description>

      <description>A search for magnetic alloys with low hysteresis In this talk, we explain how a delicate balance between material instability and magnetic constants can dramatically reduce hysteresis in magnetic alloys. These alloys find important applications in wind turbines and induction motors of electric vehicles, and our research could potentially guide in the discovery of novel soft magnets.

      <description>We draw inspiration from geometric patterns to understand the fundamental principles of symmetry. We apply these mathematical rules in the form of computer codes to generate art. For example, the following Islamic tesssellation is generated by regularly repeating a motif with star polygons (8 nodes, 22 nodes) on a hexagonal lattice.
